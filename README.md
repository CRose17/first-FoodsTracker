## The ReadMe will be used at this time to keep an eye on where this project is and ultimately where it could be.

### Currently: Have a basic modal with an alert that allows user input into an empty array and returns the input of the array via an alert.

### Still to implement: Still need some navigation tabs, some restrictions for what can be entered into input field, an about component, and redux implementation
